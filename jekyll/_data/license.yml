    Do what you want, but mention it came from me (i.e. MIT)
    but also do NOT use my name to advertise stuff.

    Do what you can (including patent it). You must mention it came from me and
    document any changes you made.

    Strong copyleft license. You can use the work (including in patents) and
    modify/redistribute it BUT you must mention it came from me, make you source
    code available under the same license, and describe your changes.

    Same as GPL, but explicitly states that providing service over a network
    counts as distribution (so source must be provided under the same license).

    Same as GPL, with an exception for dynamic linking. If you just link to my
    work, you can license your software however you like and can keep it closed
    source.
